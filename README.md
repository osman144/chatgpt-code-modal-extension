This Chrome extension enhances the ChatGPT interface by adding a modal feature to code blocks. It is designed to provide users with a more focused view of code snippets within ChatGPT's responses, allowing for better readability and interaction.

## Features

- **Modal View**: Clicking on "Open Modal" within any ChatGPT code block will open a modal with the code content for distraction-free reading.
- **Easy Navigation**: Users can easily close the modal by clicking outside the modal area, returning to the ChatGPT conversation.
- **Enhanced Readability**: Provides an expanded view of the code, ensuring that longer code blocks are easier to read and understand without leaving the chat interface.
